# This blog is not for you
How did you even find this?

<!-- more -->

## How we got here
Now, writing is something that I've been thinking about for a few months now. I've never really written creatively, only scientific papers/works. But the thought of putting some work into a "creative" piece and actually creating something just sounds nice to me. And I collected a few thoughts about topics that made me think over the last months that I just kinda want to get out of me in a structured way, which a simple conversation with a friend cannot do.
 

So, I learned about MkDocs (which is what powers this blog) since I needed to compare some software documentation tools for a work project. And I saw that there is a blog plugin for it. This gave me the idea that it should be super easy to just setup a GitHub page using MkDocs - and here we are. 

## So what now?
I'm not sure where I want to go with this blog. I'm not even entirely sure why im putting this on the internet - i don't really have the need for anyone to see what i'm writing down here. But it feels different *actually publishing* something, compared to simply writing slop into a Word document saved locally on my computer. Which is why I don't intent on telling anyone what I'm doing here. So, if you found this page, either by browsing GitHub or Google for some reason, glad you're here and feel free to look around - but don't expect to learn anything or find high quality discussions here (although I do intent to actually put some research into these posts!).

This blog is not for you. It's for me, myself and I. It's a writing exercise and supposed to help me order my thoughts about complex or abstract topics.
